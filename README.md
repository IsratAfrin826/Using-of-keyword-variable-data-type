# Using-of-keyword-variable-data-type

In C++, keywords, variables, and data types are fundamental building blocks for writing programs.

### Keywords
Keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings that the compiler recognizes. They form the core syntax of the language and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Examples 

include:

       1.int: Specifies an integer data type.
       
       2.float: Specifies a floating-point data type.
       
       3.double: Specifies a double-precision floating-point data type.
       
       4.char: Specifies a character data type.
       
       5.bool: Specifies a boolean data type (true or false).
       
       6.void: Indicates the absence of a data type.
       
       7.if, else: Control flow statements for conditional execution.
       
       8.for, while: Control flow statements for loop structures.
       
       9.class: Defines a class.
       
       10.public: Access specifier for class members.
       
       11.using: Used for namespace declarations or type aliases.
       
       12.switch, case, default: Used for multi-way branching.
       
### Variables

Variables are named storage locations that hold data values. They must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used. The data type determines the kind of values a variable can store and the
operations that can be performed on it.

### Declaration: 

 data_type variable_name;
 
 Example: int age; (declares an integer variable named age)
 
### Initialization:

 data_type variable_name = value;
 
 Example: int age = 30; (declares and initializes age to 30)
### Data Types

Data types classify the type of data a variable can hold. C++ offers several built-in data types: 

1.Integer Types:

   int: Stores whole numbers (e.g., -10, 0, 100).

   short: Stores smaller whole numbers.

   long: Stores larger whole numbers.

2.Floating-Point Types:

   float: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).

   double: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers, offering higher accuracy.

3.Character Type:

   char: Stores single characters (e.g., 'a', 'Z', '$').

4.Boolean Type:

   bool: Stores boolean values, either true or false.

5.Void Type:

   void: Represents the absence of a type, often used for functions that don't return a value.
